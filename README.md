# Cats vs Dogs Classification

## Overview
This project focuses on building a machine learning model to classify images of cats and dogs. The model is trained using a convolutional neural network (CNN) on the popular "Cats vs Dogs" dataset. The goal is to accurately distinguish between images of cats and dogs.

## Introduction
Image classification is a fundamental task in computer vision. This project uses deep learning techniques to classify images into two categories: cats and dogs. The model is built using TensorFlow and Keras.

## Dataset
The dataset used for this project is the [Kaggle Cats and Dogs Dataset](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=54765). It contains 25,000 images of cats and dogs, with an equal number of images for each class.

## Installation
To run this project, you need to have Python and the following libraries installed:
- TensorFlow
- Keras
- NumPy
- Pandas
- Matplotlib

You can install the required libraries using pip:
```bash
pip install tensorflow keras numpy pandas matplotlib
```

## Usage
1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/NelluriLokesh/Cats_vs_Dogs
    cd cats-vs-dogs
    ```

2. Download and extract the dataset:
    - Download the dataset from [here](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=54765).
    - Extract the dataset into a directory named `data`.

3. Train the model:
    ```bash
    python train.py
    ```

4. Evaluate the model:
    ```bash
    python evaluate.py
    ```

5. Make predictions:
    ```bash
    python predict.py --image_path path_to_your_image
    ```

## Model Architecture
The model architecture is based on a convolutional neural network (CNN) with the following layers:
- Convolutional layers
- Max Pooling layers
- Flatten layer
- Dense layers
- Dropout layers

## Results
The model achieves an accuracy of approximately XX% on the validation set. Here are some sample predictions:

| Image | Predicted Label | Actual Label |
|-------|------------------|--------------|
| ![Cat](sample_cat.jpg) | Cat | Cat |
| ![Dog](sample_dog.jpg) | Dog | Dog |
